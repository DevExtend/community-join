 I am Masooma as a front-end developer. I like learning new beneficial stuff, that this interest leads me to make new communications with different people. 
 I love using my mind for solving and understanding complicated questions. So, I desire to learn algorithm and backend after I learned frontend completely.
 Learning English and programming is my these days occupation, also, I help others for learning HTML and CSS.
